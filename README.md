My twine story was a representative character story, detailing the lives of people on the Mary Rose. 
This included the carpenter, the surgeon, the cook, the master gunner, the royal archer and Hatch the dog.
I used color, stylization of text, imagery, usage of conditionals and usage of variables to convey and emphasize certain points in my story.
From a userâ€™s perspective, when they open up my game, it goes to an introduction on the Mary Rose and gives them a list of people who were aboard that they can learn about.
As they click on each person they can read about them and can choose to go into further detail about their lives and specialties.
In the end, they will have learned all about life on the Mary Rose.
